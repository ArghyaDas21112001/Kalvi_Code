# IDE ( Integrated Development Environment )
 I Have build a code-running service in python using Tkinter module. On running this service, you can enter a code snippet and “run” it and obtain its output. The code is run by the backend, and the output is shown in the output section of the GUI (Think of it as a minimalist hackerrank-like coderunner).


It is a protoye of a programming environment that contains a lot of things in a single package i.e. code editor, compiler, debugger and what you see is what you get . It is actually a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. It combines all the basic tools that developers need to write or test software. This type of environment allows an application developer to write code while compiling, debugging and executing it at the same place.

It can be a standalone application or a part of one or more compatible applications.

1 .Built a MCQ test taking service. Defined a test with a collection of MCQs. On the web service, a candidate is presented with the test, provides answers, and submits. On submission the service gives the candidate the score from their session.


2. Build a code-running service (any language of your choice). On running this service, you can go to a webpage, enter a code snippet and “run” it. The code is run by the backend, and the output is shown on the webpage. (Think of it as a minimalist hackerrank-like coderunner).
